# Vanding Machine System
A C# Windows Forms application that simulates a drink vending system. Users can select drinks, and the program keeps track of inventory and sales. 
When a drink is selected, the stock is updated, and the sales total is displayed.

## Features
- **Drink Selection**: Choose from a variety of drinks:
  - Cola
  - Lemon Lime
  - Cream Soda
  - Root Beer
  - Grape Soda
- **Inventory Management**:
  - Each drink has an initial stock of 20 items.
  - When a drink is selected, the stock is updated, and the drink count is displayed.
  - If a drink is out of stock, an error message is shown.
- **Sales Tracking**:
  - The program tracks the total sales in real-time, with the total amount displayed in dollars.
  - Sales are calculated by multiplying the cost of the selected drink (in cents) by the quantity sold.
