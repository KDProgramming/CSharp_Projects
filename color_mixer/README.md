# Color Mixer
A C# Windows Forms application that allows users to mix two primary colors (red, blue, or yellow) to produce a secondary color. 
The program updates the background color of the form based on the selected colors.

## Features
- **Primary Color Selection**: Users can select two primary colors from radio buttons.
- **Dynamic Background Change**: The form's background changes to reflect the resulting color:
  - **Red + Blue = Purple**
  - **Red + Yellow = Orange**
  - **Blue + Yellow = Green**
  - Matching colors retain their original primary color.
- **Exit Button**: Provides an option to close the application.

## Technologies
- **C#**: Core programming language.
- **Windows Forms**: Used to build the graphical user interface.
- **.NET Framework**: Platform used to develop and run the application.

## How to Run
1. Open the solution file (`colorMixer.sln`) in Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project.
