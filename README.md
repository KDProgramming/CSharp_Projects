# CSharp Projects

This repository contains a collection of small C# programs that I have developed as part of my coursework. 
These programs demonstrate various C# concepts, including object-oriented programming, Windows Forms development, and data processing. Each project is self-contained and serves as a practical example of a different C# skill.
