# Email Management System
A C# Windows Forms application that allows users to manage a contact list, storing names and email addresses in a dictionary. 
The program supports adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving contacts. Data is persisted to a file so that the contact list is saved and loaded automatically.

## Features
- **Add New Contacts**: Input a name and email address to add a new contact.
- **Lookup by Email**: Search for a contact by their email address and retrieve their name.
- **Update Email Address**: Update the email address for an existing contact.
- **Delete Contacts**: Remove a contact by providing their name and email address.
- **Data Persistence**:
  - Automatically loads contacts from a file (`Dictionary.txt`) when the program starts.
  - Saves all changes to the contact list back to the file when the program closes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Clear input fields after each operation.
  - Descriptive error messages for invalid inputs.

## Technologies
- **C#**: Core programming language.
- **Windows Forms**: Used to build the graphical user interface.
- **.NET Framework**: Platform used to develop and run the application.
